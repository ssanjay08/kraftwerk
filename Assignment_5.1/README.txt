I used the data provided in the problem set from the “UCI Machine Learning Repository,” 
which was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. 
My analysis focuses on Coffee House visitors based on their age, gender, marital 
status, income, education, occupation, and frequency of visits. 
Summary: 
 Age: Younger visitors, especially those below 21, have a higher acceptance rate. 
 Gender: Males have a slightly higher acceptance rate than females. 
 Marital Status: Divorced and single visitors have higher acceptance rates 
compared to widowed visitors. 
 Income: Visitors with lower income levels ($12,500 - $24,999) have a higher 
acceptance rate. 
 Education: Acceptance rates are fairly consistent across different education 
levels. 
 Occupation: Students and those in transportation and material moving 
occupations have higher acceptance rates. 
 Frequency of Visits: Visitors who frequent coffee houses more often are more 
likely to accept coffee house coupons.
